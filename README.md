# Experiment 46: Abstract Class (Shapes)

## Problem Statement

Write a Java program to create an abstract class named `Shape` that contains an empty method named `numberOfSides()`.
Provide three classes named `Rectangle`, `Triangle`, and `Hexagon` such that each one of the classes extends the class `Shape`.
Each one of the classes contains only the method `numberOfSides()` that shows the number of sides in the given geometrical structures.

## Input Format

* No input.

## Output Format

* Number of sides of Rectangle.
* Number of sides of Triangle.
* Number of sides of Hexagon.

### Example 1

**Input:**

```text
No input
```

**Output:**

```text
Rectangle has 4 sides
Triangle has 3 sides
Hexagon has 6 sides
```
